# Classification Model: Alzheimer Prediction 
To run the program(s):
* Download the repo
* Ensure you have `python 2 or 3` as well as `pickle`, `streamlit`, `numpy` installed
* Run streamlit DeployApp.py 
* Enjoy!

# About the Application 
→ Machine learning model develop through Python and several modules 

→ DESIGN OF A MACHINE LEARNING BASED MODEL TO TRANSLATE FOR APHASIA AND/OR ALZHEIMER’S DISEASES

→ Purpose: To develop a machine learning-based method to early diagnose dementia using the dataset obtained from OASIS. 
Classification algorithms such as GaussianNB, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost, LGBMClassifier, CatBoost, and GradientBoosting are used to find accuracy, recall, precision and confusion matrix. 

→ Implementation of the following algorithms provides accuracy in the range of 80 to 90 percent
