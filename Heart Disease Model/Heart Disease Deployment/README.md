# About the Application
→ Machine Learning model focused on real-time prediction of heart disease based on a real-time data

→ It uses a variety of features, including age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical indicators, to classify the heart condition into two categories: **Nondefective heart** and **Defective heart**

→  Regular updates and retraining with new data ensure continuous enhancement of the model's accuracy and reliability.

→ During the training phase, the model learns from labeled data, capturing intricate relationships through techniques such as deep learning or ensemble methods.

→ In the prediction phase, it takes in real-time data and displays a probability or binary prediction, enabling healthcare professionals to make timely and informed decisions for diagnosis and intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
